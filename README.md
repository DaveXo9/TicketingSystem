Ticketing System in Laravel
This project was developed during my internship and aims to create a ticketing system using Laravel framework. In this context, a ticket represents a task or an issue that needs to be addressed. For instance, when a user contacts the customer service to report a problem, an agent on the other end opens a ticket with a description of the corresponding issue.

Basic Features Implemented:
Migrations: Database migrations were created for all the necessary tables.
Models: Corresponding models and their relationships were defined.
Controllers: CRUD operations were supported with dedicated controllers for each model.
Routes: Appropriate routes were set up for the controllers.
Factory and Seeder: Seed data was generated for the database using factories and seeders.
Client Interface: The necessary interfaces were implemented on the client-side.


Additional Features:
Upon completing the basic project requirements, I was assigned new tasks to further develop the application.

Search Bar Implementation:

The search functionality was integrated into the application, allowing users to easily find specific tickets based on their descriptions or other relevant criteria.
Notifications using Laravel Broadcasting and Pusher Service:

Implemented a notification system within the application using Laravel broadcasting in conjunction with the Pusher service. This enables real-time updates and alerts for users about important events or changes related to their tickets.
Agent Communication via Chat (Pusher):

Developed a communication feature that facilitates chat between agents using the Pusher service. This ensures seamless and efficient collaboration among team members.

Message Filtering:
Implemented the ability to filter messages based on their content, making it easier for agents to find and focus on relevant information during their interactions.
