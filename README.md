Ticketing System in Laravel
This project was developed during my internship and aims to create a ticketing system using Laravel framework. In this context, a ticket represents a task or an issue that needs to be addressed. For instance, when a user contacts the customer service to report a problem, an agent on the other end opens a ticket with a description of the corresponding issue.

Basic Features Implemented:
Migrations: Database migrations were created for all the necessary tables.
Models: Corresponding models and their relationships were defined.
Controllers: CRUD operations were supported with dedicated controllers for each model.
Routes: Appropriate routes were set up for the controllers.
Factory and Seeder: Seed data was generated for the database using factories and seeders.
Client Interface: The necessary interfaces were implemented on the client-side.
Additional Features:
Upon completing the basic project requirements, I was assigned new tasks to further develop the application.

Search Bar Implementation:

The search functionality was integrated into the application, allowing users to easily find specific tickets based on their descriptions or other relevant criteria.
Notifications using Laravel Broadcasting and Pusher Service:

Implemented a notification system within the application using Laravel broadcasting in conjunction with the Pusher service. This enables real-time updates and alerts for users about important events or changes related to their tickets.
Agent Communication via Chat (Pusher):

Developed a communication feature that facilitates chat between agents using the Pusher service. This ensures seamless and efficient collaboration among team members.
Message Filtering:

Implemented the ability to filter messages based on their content, making it easier for agents to find and focus on relevant information during their interactions.
This project showcases various aspects of Laravel development, including database management, API creation, real-time communication, and more. Feel free to explore the code and documentation to understand the implementation details and structure of the ticketing system. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out. Happy coding!
